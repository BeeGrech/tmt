summary: Maintainer contact

story:
    As a developer reviewing a plan, a story or a complex test
    which failed I would like to contact the person who
    maintains the code and understands it well.

description: |
    When there are several people collaborating on plans, tests or
    stories it's useful to have a way to find who is responsible
    for what. Must be a ``string`` or a ``list of strings`` (email
    address format with name and surname).

    .. versionchanged:: 1.30

        Previously the ``contact`` field was available for tests
        only, now it can be used for plans and stories as well.

example:
  - |
    # Single contact
    contact: Name Surname <email@address.org>

  - |
    # Multiple contacts
    contact:
      - First Person <first@address.org>
      - Second Person <second@address.org>
